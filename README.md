# BowWow Bookshelf

> BowWow Bookshelf is a mini library where you can find facts about different breeds of dogs.
> If you are a dog lover, it's especially for you *wink*.
> It takes some time for the data to load from the API. Just be patient when the data loads *hehe*

### Screenshots
> Will be added once the project is completed
